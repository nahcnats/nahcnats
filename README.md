### Hi I'm Stan ðŸ‘‹

My name is Stanley Chan. I am a freelance programmer from Malaysia with focus on React Native, VueJs, NuxtJs and ExpressJs.

  More stuff about me
</summary>
<br>
I started picking up programming again in 2017. I stopped practicing it in 2000. I used to code reports in INFORMIX 4GL. It was hard picking it up again. I had to relearn everything as the current tech is totally different to what I was exposed to before.
<br><br>
So yeah, I'd see myself as a self taught programmer.

  - **Server FlexiTs**. Server app and API for FlexiTs system develop using NuxtJs, ExpressJs with socket.io. The database is MySQL hosted in my Digital Ocean droplet in an Ubuntu environment served via Nginx. All the mobile APIs are done. Hence, I'm building both the webapp and APIs for it currently. The source code for this is unfortunately in my private repository as I borrowed some business logic from Transact2's API, although it's a complete rewrite based off my memory.
