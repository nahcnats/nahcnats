### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Stanley Chan. I am a freelance programmer from Malaysia with focus on React Native, VueJs, NuxtJs and ExpressJs. Welcome to my Github page!

#### A Brief History of myself
I started picking up coding again in 2017 after more than a decade not practising it. Between 1996 - 1998 I was a junior programmer coding reports in INFORMIX 4GL with a manufacturing company. Between 1998 - 2000 I dabbled with Java Servlets and PHP and then I stopped! Back to 2017 when I picked it up again, I had to completely relearn everything. So, I can categorized myself as self-taught programmer.

#### Past / Current Activities
- Completed Projects ...
  - **transact2 ClockIT**. A full stack mobile attendance system I developed while I was a developer with [Transact2 Sdn Bhd](https://transact2.com/). The API server was developed with ExpressJs, the web frontend with VueJs with Vuex and the mobile app with React Native (bare workflow). The database is MySQL. The app was released to the public in both Apple and GooglePlay Store somewhere around November - December 2018.
  - **TheShop**. A React Native Expo shopping app based on one of [React Native - The Practical Guide [2021 Edition]](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WauB0QcclpUTXw=/) tutorial. The objective of following this course module was to 1, experience Expo (so convenient) and 2, learn a some good coding habits.
  - **GreatPlaces**. A React Native Expo simple app I followed from [React Native - The Practical Guide [2021 Edition]](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WauB0QcclpUTXw=/) tutorial. This is just to pick up using Expo's geolocation instead of the bare workflow method. Again, using Expo is so much more convenient.
  
- Iâ€™m currently working on ...
  - **mobile-flexits**. A mobile attendance app develop using React Native Expo currently named [**Mobile FlexiTs**](https://github.com/nahcnats/mobile-flexits). It's a hobby project, a complete rewrite of the original app I wrote for a company (Transact2) between 2018 - 2019.
  - **flextits-server**. A mobile attendance server develop using NuxtJs, ExpressJs with socket.io. The database is MySQL hosted in Digital Ocean Ubuntu environment served via Nginx. I don't when when I will finish this. It is currently serving the APIs for me to test Mobile FlexiTs. Currently it only has the authentication page and the main clocking activity screen. The source for this is unfortunately in my private repository as I borrowed some business logic from Transact2's API, although it's a complete rewrite based off my memory.
