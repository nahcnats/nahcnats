### Hi I'm Stan ðŸ‘‹

My name is Stanley Chan. I am a freelance programmer from Malaysia with focus on React Native, VueJs, NuxtJs and ExpressJs.

  More stuff about me
</summary>
<br>
I started picking up programming again in 2017. I stopped practicing it in 2000. I used to code reports in INFORMIX 4GL. It was hard picking it up again. I had to relearn everything as the current tech is totally different to what I was exposed to before.
<br><br>
So yeah, I'd see myself as a self taught programmer.

#### Past / Current activities
- Completed projects ...
  - **transact2 ClockIT**. A full stack mobile attendance system I developed while I was a developer with [Transact2 Sdn Bhd](https://transact2.com/). The API server was developed with ExpressJs, the web frontend with VueJs with Vuex and the mobile app with React Native (bare workflow). The database is MySQL. The app was released to the public in both Apple and GooglePlay Store somewhere around November - December 2019. Below is a short demo video.

#### Hobby Projects
- Completed projects ...
  - **[The Shop](https://github.com/nahcnats/rnTheShop)**. A simple React Native Expo shopping app. [Click here for demo](https://expo.io/@nahcnats/projects/sctheshop). You need to install Expo Client. Go to GooglePlay Store and search for 'Expo Client'. Download it. Once you've downloaded it, open it and there's a function you can scan QR code. After you scanned, the app will launch. Click the 'Switch To Sign Up'  button, enter some dummy email and password, you're good to go. If your on iOS, sorry :disappointed:. iOS only works on invites.
  - **[Great Places](https://github.com/nahcnats/greatplaces)**. A React Native Expo simple app to try out Expo's geolocation instead of the bare workflow method.
  - **[Mobile FlexiTs](https://github.com/nahcnats/mobile-flexits)**. Mobile app develop using React Native Expo, one part of FlexiTs Mobile Attendance system. A complete rewrite of the original app I wrote  for a company (Transact2) between 2018 - 2020. Please [contact me](mailto:nahcnats@gmail.com) if you want to try the demo as I use Google's services for this app, [click here](https://expo.io/@nahcnats/projects/mobile-flexits). Screenshots will be available soon.

  - FlexiTs Mobile Attendance system
    - **flextits-server**. Server app and API develop using NuxtJs, ExpressJs with socket.io. The database is MySQL hosted in my Digital Ocean droplet in an Ubuntu environment served via Nginx. I don't when when I will finish this. It is currently serving the APIs for me to test Mobile FlexiTs. Currently it only has the authentication page and the main clocking activity screen. The source code for this is unfortunately in my private repository as I borrowed some business logic from Transact2's API, although it's a complete rewrite based off my memory.
